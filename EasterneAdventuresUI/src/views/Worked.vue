        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>The Van Zyl family started the drilling business more than 35 years ago when the founding member, JJ van Zyl started Van Zyl Boorwerke.</h3>

        <h3>At his side was his wife, Mrs. W.A. van Zyl and later his sons Martin, Hannes and Dirk joined the business after school and national service.
            Unfortunately JJ van Zyl passed away in 2010 but left a behind a legacy that is rich in management and technical skills and knowledge built up over the last 
            three decades.
        </h3>


        <h3>The ‘young blood” also made significant expansion opportunities possible by venturing into the corporate market and 
            obtaining work at major mining houses and corporations.
            The business started out by drilling boreholes (mainly for water) for businesses and private property owners. 
            During the past couple of years, the business entered into a capital expansion program by acquiring different types of drilling 
            rigs and their latest technology consist of compressors to expand operations and to shorten production time.
